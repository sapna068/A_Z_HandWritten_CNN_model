# A_Z_HandWritten_CNN_model
Building a CNN model for A_Z_Handwritten_Data

Problem Statement: Building a CNN model for A_Z_Handwritten_Data and analyse model performance

Dataset: A_Z_Hadwritten_Data.csv

This project aims to develop a  module for predicting alphabets. 
The csv file consists of the pixels for alphabets. While analysing the dataset it was found that the csv 0th column consists of the labels(0-25) representing letters from A-Z . A cnn model has been build to train the dataset as there were multiclass classification of images is there and evaluate model accuracy and performance using confusion matrix. 

Steps  to run the notebook:
 a)cmd-->jupyter notebook, new-->pyhton3
 a)all the required libraries and versions are attached to requirements.txt , install all those with pip install
 b)load the data set to jupyter notebook with name A_Z_Hadwritten_Data.csv
 c)after data split , the train  test data and label will be there in jupyternotebook only
 d)All the preprocessing and building cnn model has been done in A_Z_Hadwritten_CNN ipynb file
